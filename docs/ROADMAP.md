# Nebulus Atom: Strategic Roadmap (Architect's View)

## Current State (The "Autonomous Core")
We have successfully built the "Autonomous Core", enabling resilience and evolution:
*   ✅ **Phase 1 (Maturity)**: Test Harness & Headless Execution.
*   ✅ **Phase 2 (Cognition)**: Reflection Loop ("Think before Act").
*   ✅ **Phase 3 (Memory)**: RAG (Context Recall).
*   ✅ **Phase 4 (Resilience)**: Self-Healing Loop (Error Recovery).
*   ✅ **Phase 5 (Evolution)**: Dynamic Skills (Tool Creation).
*   ✅ **Phase 6 (Observability)**: Telemetry "Flight Recorder".

The agent is now self-healing, capable of learning, and fully observable. It is no longer a simple script but a robust autonomous entity.

## Completed Milestones (V1 Release)
We have successfully built and deployed **Nebulus Atom V1**:
*   ✅ **Phase 1-6 (Core)**: Autonomy, Memory, Resilience, Skills, Telemetry.
*   ✅ **Phase 7 (Control Plane)**: TUI & Dashboard.
*   ✅ **Phase 8 (Swarm)**: Multi-Agent Orchestration.
*   ✅ **Phase 9 (Deployment)**: Secure Docker Containerization.
*   ✅ **Phase 10 (Identity)**: Rebranding to "Nebulus Atom".
*   ✅ **Phase 11 (Refactor)**: Codebase migration to `nebulus_atom` package.

## Future Horizons (V2)
The foundation is complete. Future work will focus on:
1.  **Advanced Cognition**: Implementing "System 2" thinking loops for deeper reasoning.
2.  **Marketplace**: Sharing skills via community registry.

**Status**: V1 STABLE / PRODUCTION READY
